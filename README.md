# Car-Detection-and-Tracking-using-Detectron2

Developed and trained a car detection model using the Detectron2 library, achieving robust performance on a custom dataset. 

Implemented data preprocessing, model configuration, training, evaluation (including precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization), and optimized inference for both image and video processing. Utilized YOLO format annotations, converted to Detectron2's required format. Addressed potential model loading and dataset registration issues with robust error handling. 

Deployed the model for real-time video processing with optimized frame rates and resolution for efficient display. Evaluated model performance with COCO metrics and custom evaluation scripts for detailed analysis. Optimized video output for Kaggle display by reducing resolution, frame rate, and file size, and compressing the output using FFmpeg.

File has been run for convenience.
